Serval hoststack
==================

To compile:

First time you check out, prepare the build system:

# ./autogen.sh

To configure the build system:

# ./configure [ --enable-debug | --disable-kernel ]

To build:

# make

Directory structure
-------------------
include/		headers that are shared between components under src/.

src/			source code.

src/stack/		stack code.

src/stack/linux/	stack code specific for the linux kernel.

src/stack/userlevel/	stack code specific for user level.

src/libstack/		library that makes it easy to interact with the stack 
			from user space, independent of stack version (kernel/user).

src/servd/		user space control daemon for the stack (uses libstack).

src/test/		test programs for the stack.

src/libserval/		socket API abstraction for client applications interacting 
			with the user level version of the stack.

src/javasock/		Java bindings that make it possible to write Serval 
			applications in Java.

android/		Android specific files and applications.
	
Cross-compile Linux kernel module
---------------------------------

Prerequisites:

* Kernel source code matching your cross-compile environment.
* A tool-chain for your cross-compile architecture.

Run (./autogen.sh) ./configure to generate Makefiles

Enter src/stack and issue the following command (example for Android):

> make serval.ko ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<Path to NDK)/build/prebuilt/darwin-x86/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin/arm-eabi- KDIR=<Path to kernel source>


Running Serval in user-level mode
---------------------------------

Start the user-level stack

> ./src/stack/serval [ -i <iface> ] 

Start servd:

> ./src/servd/servd

Wait until a service router is discovered or a timeout occurs (in
which case host control mode is set).

Start any clients, e.g.:

> ./src/test/udp_server

Connect with telnet to 127.0.0.1:9999 for printing internal state.


Running Serval in kernel mode
-----------------------------

Insert the Serval kernel module:

> insmod ./src/stack/serval.ko

Start servd:

> ./src/servd/servd

Wait until a service router is discovered or a timeout occurs (in
which case host control mode is set).

Start any clients, e.g.,:

> ./src/test/udp_servern

Access internal state and debug output through /proc/net/serval/.

When done, shut down all clients and servd, then remove Serval module:

> rmmod serval
