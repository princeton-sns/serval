Serval test applications
========================

This directory contains small programs that test common functionality
in the Serval stack. They may also serve as examples of how to write
applications that use the PF_SERVAL protocol family.

Some applications are compiled into two versions. Binaries that have
the "_user" suffix work with the user-level version of the stack,
while other binaries are for the kernel version.

The following provides a brief description of each application:

send_udp_packet - Sends a single Serval UDP packet to a given
		  destination IP. This can be used to, e.g., test
		  wide-area connectivity where NATs or other
		  middleboxes may interfer with Serval.

recv_udp_packet - Receive a Serval UDP packet on a serviceID. This is
		  the receiver side of send_udp_packet.

bindtest - Tests the functionality of the bind() call.

listentest - Tests the functionality of the listen() call.

udp_server - A server that runs "connected UDP" and prints received
	     text to stdout. The received text is also converted to
	     upper case and echoed back to the client

udp_client - The client connnecting to udp_server. Takes input from
	     stdin and sends to the server, essentially implementing a
	     chat client.

tcp_client - A Serval TCP client that sends a data stream (either a
	     file or random data) to a Serval TCP server sink. Can
	     also run "regular" TCP over PF_INET sockets, allowing a
	     direct performance comparison between Serval and the
	     regular TCP/IP stack.

tcp_server - The server sink for tcp_client.

manysockets - Program that simply creates a number of sockets,
	      allowing the stack to be stress tested.
